#World History 101 with Annoying Italian Plumber

It’s a game. It’s about one certain annoying Italian plumber as you might have guessed.  What’s so special about this game you ask? 
Well, apart from the fact that it will be created by a rag-tag group of three slightly sad high schoolers, it’s new. We have seen and played countless games. And the fact is that they’re so predictive. 
So, we want to bring you something, you haven’t seen before. A completely honest game. This is certainly going to be the funniest thing you see at NPSK Hackathon. 
But enough about this. Let’s talk about what you want to hear. How are we going to make it? 
Well, as always, God Bless Python. We’re going to use pygame and some other built-in modules of python to bring to you a cool, innovative and funny Mari – I mean Italian Plumber game. 
Don’t worry, we aren’t ripping off the original plumber game. We just want to use him as our character, because frankly we can’t really think of something funnier than a plumber eating some ‘shrooms. 
Anyway, our game is an amalgamation and parody of different kinds of arcade games. We plan to have five levels.

1)	Level 1: The sidescroller: Well you move sideways. Also, this will be our tutorial level.
2)	Level 2: The catapult game with crazy physics engine: As you progress we go onto this game where you break down the enemy’s defences by hurling ammunition at them. 
3)	Level 3: Marathon: It’s the classic run from baddie while obstacles become harder to evade. 
4)	Level 4: The brickbreaker: We use classic 2-D and create a beautiful wall. Break it. 
5)	Level 5: The secret level: We can’t tell you anything about this. But between you and me….it is going to be set in NPS Koramangala. Wouldn’t want to miss that.
So, in conclusion, our game is new, funny and has a lot of elements which are going to be hard to pull off in a short while. But it’s definitely going to be worth it. It’s essentially 5 games in 1. And you have a funky Italian guy to guide you. Sounds pretty awesome.
